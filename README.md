# CS50x
CS50x Problem Sets. Most from 2018. Some from 2019.

Some files are not the best solution or not even a solution at all, but rather experimentation with functions or modules I wanted to have a go at just for fun. Such files or folders are marked with a "exp-" prefix.

Notably, in 2019/Pset6 crack.py I experiemented a lot with Python Standard Library's multiprocessing module. None of my code here is a good solution to the problem set. But you can run it on your local machine and use something like macOS's Activity Monitor, in order to see how I used the multiprocessing module, to enable my program to be executed on multiple CPUs in parallel (effectively bypassing Python's single-threadedness that is enforced by the Global Interpreter Lock in the CPython interpreter)
